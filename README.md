📸 Google Slides Manual Capture
This Tampermonkey script allows you to manually capture slides from a Google Slides presentation that is either in "publish to the web" (/pubembed) mode or embedded directly into a website. It captures the slides as high-resolution PNG images and packages them into a single ZIP file for easy download.

✨ Features
Works Everywhere: Captures slides from both the dedicated pubembed link and any website where a Google Slides presentation is embedded.

- Manual Control: You decide which slides to capture and when to capture them.
- High-Resolution Output: Generates images at a fixed 1920x1080 resolution for clear, high-quality results.
- Real-time Notifications: A subtle pop-up notification confirms each successful slide capture.
- Convenient Download: A single click downloads all captured images as a compressed .zip file.
