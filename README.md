# Tampermonkey Script Google Slides Manual Capture
This Tampermonkey script allows you to manually capture slides from a Google Slides presentation that is either in "publish to the web" (/pubembed) mode or embedded directly into a website. It captures the slides as high-resolution PNG images and packages them into a single ZIP file for easy download.
